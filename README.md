# Fake-News-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Fifth Project using Logistic Regression model for prediction  
Note : weight represent how important particular feature is for example we have several columns title, author , text etc 
and for example particular column has 0.9 weight value that means that particular column is very important for the prediction
for example text column has very lower weight that means that column is not as much as important for our prediction look logistic regression image
